# Essential Linux Programs
Storing config files in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/DrewHans555/dotfiles/) repo turned out to be a really great idea. It saves me time when setting up a new system and it acts as a single source of config-truth across all my existing systems & VMs. To further simplify setting up new systems I decided to write this text file listing what I consider to be essential linux programs. Most of these are obvious choices but listing them out like this is convenient. Your mileage may vary.

Note: this list does not contain programs installed by default on most Linux distros.
